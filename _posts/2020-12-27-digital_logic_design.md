<h2 id="Levels-of-abtraction-in-an-electronic-computing-system">Levels of abtraction in an electronic computing system<a class="anchor-link" href="#Levels-of-abtraction-in-an-electronic-computing-system"> </a></h2><p><img src="/blog/images/copied_from_nb/images/digital_logic_design/abstractions.png" alt="levels of abstraction"></p>
<p>The lowest level of abstraction is in physics, at the level of electrons. The behaviour of these electrons are decribed by quantum mechanics.
The transistors have well-defined connection points called terminals and can be modelled by
relationship between voltage and current at these terminals. This level helps to ignore the electrons
and work with transistors.
Analog circuits assemble these devices to create components such as amplifiers. Analog circuits work with continuous range of voltages, while digital circuits restrict the voltage to discrete ranges. Logic design use components in digital circuits to build more complex structures like adders, memories etc.</p>
<p>Microarchitecure links the logic and architecture levels, while architecture is the level describes the computer to a programmer. For eg., Intel x86 architecture describes a set of instructions and registers a programmer is allowed to use. Microarchitecture executes these instructions using logic circuits. A particular architecture can be implemented using one of many different microarchitectures (Intel core i7, Intel 80486 and AMD Athlon all implement the same Intel x86 architecture with different performance tradeoffs like price and performance).</p>
<p>OS handles low level tasks like memory management and disk management. Finally, application software uses the platform provided by OS to solve various problems for the end user.</p>

<h3 id="Sign/Magnitude-numbers">Sign/Magnitude numbers<a class="anchor-link" href="#Sign/Magnitude-numbers"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>A N-bit sign/magnitude number uses the first bit for sign and the remaining N-1 bits for magnitude.</li>
<li>intuitively appealing</li>
<li>sign bit of 0 is positive and sign bit of 1 is negative</li>
<li>ordinary addition does not work</li>
<li>N-bit sign/magnitude number ranges from $[-(2^{N-1} - 1) , (2^{N-1} - 1)]$</li>
<li>two representation for 0, +0 and -0 can be a problem</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Two's-complement-numbers">Two's complement numbers<a class="anchor-link" href="#Two's-complement-numbers"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>identical to unsigned binary numbers except that the msb has a weight of $-2^{N-1}$ instead of $2^{N-1}$.</li>
<li>Range of an N-bit two's complement number $[-2^{N-1}, 2^{N-1} - 1]$</li>
<li>zero has a single representation and ordinary addition works.</li>
<li>all positive numbers have 0 in the msb and all negative number have a 1. Eventhough the representation is similar to sign/magnitude numbers, the numbers are intepreted differently.</li>
<li>Sign of a two's complement number can be reversed in a process called <em>taking the two's complement</em>.<ul>
<li>To take the two's complement of a number, reverse all the bits in the number and add 1 to the result.</li>
<li>This is useful to find the represenatation of a negative number or to find the magnitude of a negative number.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sign extension: When two's complement number is extended to more bits, the sign bit should moved to the most significant bit.</li>
