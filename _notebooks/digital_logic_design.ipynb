    "\n",
    "The lowest level of abstraction is in physics, at the level of electrons. The behaviour of these electrons are decribed by quantum mechanics.\n",
    "The transistors have well-defined connection points called terminals and can be modelled by\n",
    "relationship between voltage and current at these terminals. This level helps to ignore the electrons\n",
    "and work with transistors.\n",
    "Analog circuits assemble these devices to create components such as amplifiers. Analog circuits work with continuous range of voltages, while digital circuits restrict the voltage to discrete ranges. Logic design use components in digital circuits to build more complex structures like adders, memories etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microarchitecure links the logic and architecture levels, while architecture is the level describes the computer to a programmer. For eg., Intel x86 architecture describes a set of instructions and registers a programmer is allowed to use. Microarchitecture executes these instructions using logic circuits. A particular architecture can be implemented using one of many different microarchitectures (Intel core i7, Intel 80486 and AMD Athlon all implement the same Intel x86 architecture with different performance tradeoffs like price and performance).\n",

    "OS handles low level tasks like memory management and disk management. Finally, application software uses the platform provided by OS to solve various problems for the end user."
